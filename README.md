The objective would be to design and implement a multi-agent system to manage traffic at an intersection or multiple intersections efficiently. Agents should communicate with each other and coordinate to manage traffic lights, aiming to minimize waiting times and improve traffic flow.
- Implement intelligent traffic light agents that can adapt to traffic conditions in real time;
- Use vehicle agents that generate simplified but realistic traffic patterns;
- Integrate these agents to work in a coordinated way to optimize traffic flow;
- Predict interruptions in traffic flow so that other agents can adapt to avoid them.

In this project, Docker and Python were used.
